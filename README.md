# Fine-tuning BioBERT for QA task
 In this repository, we build a QA system using fine-tuned pre-trained language representations model BioBERT on SQUAD2.0 to answer questions based on the contexts from Cord-19 dataset.
you will find the CORD-19 dataset in this link [CORD-19](https://allenai.org/data/cord-19)
